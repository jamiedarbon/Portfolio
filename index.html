                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p id="text">
                        I am a self-motivated and driven individual who is always striving to improve and willing to
                        learn. From a young age, I have spent time learning and developing skills which I now use to
                        bring myself an income as a self-employed artist and designer online. During my time in
                        secondary school, I balanced my education with making comics which I published every
                        week, helping me to develop time management skills. I've always had an interest in
                        computers and video games, which have fueled my professional development and informed
                        my career choices. Along with developing artistic skills, I spent a lot of time growing up
                        developing technical skills relating to game development and am proficient in various
                        coding languages such as C#, HLSL, Java and Javascript.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        In my spare time, I like to work on a range of creative projects such as video editing, art, and
                        game development. I am currently using my skills to work on an experimental 3D game about
                        graffiti in the Unity engine where I have created all the assets myself, including 3D models
                        and shaders written in HLSL. I am also semi-fluent in French, having studied it up to A-Level
                        and continuing to study it in my spare time in the years since.

                        For example, this website is entirely my own work, with all code, design and content being
                        made solely by myself. Below, you will find various examples of my work, organised into which role

                            <p>Graffiti Street is the project I worked on for my final dissertation at the University of Sussex. In this project, I aimed to create a game which utilises 
                            modern technologies to provide the player with an environment in which they could interact with the game world by drawing onto it. It is for this reason that 
                            the theme of graffiti was chosen.<br /> <br />
                            In this project, I handled all the programming, design, modelling and art myself. The project required me to learn how to create my own shaders in Unity through 
                            the use of HLSL coding, in which I created the cel shader and outline shader you can see in the accompanying video. As previously mentioned, this project 
                            was made with the Unity engine, meaning the majority of the code outside of shaders was written in C#. I also used my existing skills in Blender to create the 
                            models which you can see in the game. Graffiti Street is in active development and is being updated outside of the scope of university, now that I have 
                            graduated.<br />
                            <br />
