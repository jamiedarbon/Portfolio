                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p id="text">
                        I am a self-motivated and driven individual who is always striving to improve and willing to
                        learn. From a young age, I have spent time learning and developing skills which I now use to<br />
                        bring myself an income as a self-employed artist and designer online. During my time in
                        secondary school, I balanced my education with making comics which I published every<br />
                        week, helping me to develop time management skills. I’ve always had an interest in
                        computers and video games, which have fueled my professional development and informed<br />
                        my career choices. Along with developing artistic skills, I spent a lot of time growing up
                        developing technical skills relating to game development and am proficient in various<br />
                        coding languages such as C, C++, C#, HLSL, Java and Javascript.<br />
                        <br />
                        In my spare time, I like to work on a range of creative projects such as video editing, art, and
                        game development. I am currently using my skills to work on an experimental 3D game about<br />
                        graffiti in the Unity engine where I have created all the assets myself, including 3D models
                        and shaders written in HLSL. I am also semi-fluent in French, having studied it up to A-Level<br />
                        and continuing to study it in my spare time in the years since.<br />
